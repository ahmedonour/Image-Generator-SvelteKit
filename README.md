# Introduction:

OnourAi is an Arabic AI Image Generator that utilizes the SvelteKit framework, the OpenAI API, and a translating API to generate images based on user inputs. The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use tool for users to create customized images in the Arabic language, even if they are not fluent in Arabic themselves. The AI algorithms will generate images based on user-provided input and translate the generated text into English for the final output.

## Features:

The following are the main features of the OnourAi application:

* User Input: Users can input text in English or Arabic to generate an image.
    
* Translation: The application uses a translating API to translate user input into Arabic for image generation.
    
* AI Image Generation: The application uses the OpenAI API to generate an image based on user input.
    
* Customization: Users can customize the generated image by choosing from a range of available styles and colour schemes.
    
* Download and Share: Users can download the generated image and share it on social media.
    

## Technologies Used:

The following technologies were used to build the OnourAi application:

* **SvelteKit**: SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications. It was used to build the front end of the OnourAi application.
    
* **OpenAI API:** The OpenAI API was used to generate the images based on user input.
    
* **Translating API:** A translating API was used to translate user input into Arabic.
    
* **HTML/CSS:** HTML/CSS was used to design and style the user interface of the application.
    
* **JavaScript**: JavaScript was used to add interactivity and functionality to the user interface.
    

## Project Structure:

The project consists of the following components:

* **Index Page:** The main landing page of the application where users can input their text and generate an image.
    
* **Result Page:** The page where the generated image is displayed along with options to download and share it.
    
* **API:** The backend API that handles user input, translation, and image generation.
